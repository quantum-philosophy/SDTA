.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 

.SS "template<class EOT> class peoAggEvalFunc< EOT >"
The \fBpeoAggEvalFunc\fP class offers only the interface for creating aggregate evaluation functions - there are no direct internal functions provided. 

The class inherits \fBpublic eoBF< EOT&, const typename EOT :: Fitness&, void >\fP thus requiring, for the derived classes, the creation of a function having the following signature:
.PP
void operator()( EOT& __eot, const typename EOT :: Fitness& __partial_fittness );      
.PP
The aggregation object is called in an iterative manner for each of the results obtained by applying partial evaluation functions.
