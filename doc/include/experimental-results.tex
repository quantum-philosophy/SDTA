In order to demonstrate the speed and accuracy of the proposed solution, we apply it in the context of temperature-aware energy and reliability optimization.

\subsection{System Model}
There is a number of processing elements (PE) that could have different types of architecture:
\[
  PE = \{ PE_i \}
\]

\note{If we can to investigate the dependency between the reliability and the thermal cycling, then we should choose the most exposed configuration to this thermal cycling. Therefore, DVFS seems to be a good example, because it is what exactly it does --- causes voltage/frequency and, consequently, temperature variations.}

Each processing element $PE_i$ is DVFS-aware, therefore, it has a number of active states $S_i$ characterized by corresponding supply voltage $v_{ij}$ and frequency $f_{ij}$:
\begin{align*}
  & PE_i \rightarrow S_i = \{ s_{ij} \} \\
  & s_{ij} \rightarrow (v_{ij}, f_{ij})
\end{align*}

Also there is a number of applications and data dependencies between them represented by a task graph:
\begin{align*}
  & G = (\Pi, \Gamma) \\
  & \Pi = \{\tau_i\} \\
  & \Gamma = \{\gamma_i\}
\end{align*}

Each pair of task $\tau_j$ and processing element $PE_i$ is described by effective switched capacitance $C_{eff \; ij}$ and the worse case number of clock cycles $WNC_{ij}$:
\[
  (PE_i, \tau_j) \rightarrow (C_{eff \; ij}, WNC_{ij})
\]

At the same time, each task has a deadline $dl_j$.

\subsection{Temperature-Aware Energy Optimization}
The total power consumption of a task is a sum of the dynamic power and the leakage power:
\begin{align*}
  & P = P_{dyn} + P_{leak} \\
  & P_{dyn} = C_{eff} V^2 f \\
  & P_{leak} = V I_{leak} = V (MT + N)
\end{align*}

For the leakage part of the power consumption we use a linear approximation presented in \cite{liu2007}. $M$ and $N$ are the leakage coefficients that are calculated at the reference temperature $T_{ref}$ using Taylor series expansion of the initial equation for the leakage current $I_{leak}$.

Therefore, the energy loss is:
\begin{align*}
  & E = (P_{dyn} + P_{leak}) t \\
  & E = V (C_{eff} V f + MT + N) \frac{NC}{f}
\end{align*}
where $NC$ is the number of clock cycles.

The energy dissipation depends on a particular processing element, its active state, and a particular task.

\subsection{Temperature-Aware Reliability Optimization}
We address the thermal cycling (TC) component of common failure mechanisms, which also contain electromigration, time dependent dielectric breakdown, and stress migration \cite{xiang2010}.
