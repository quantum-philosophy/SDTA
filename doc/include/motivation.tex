Consider a toy application with six tasks, denoted ``T0''--``T5'', and a heterogeneous architecture with two cores, labeled ``PE0'' and ``PE1''. The task graph of the application is given in \figref{fig:task-graph}. The initial mapping, schedule, and resulting SSDTP are shown at the top of \figref{fig:motivation}, where PE0 is experiencing three thermal cycles. If we change the allocation of T5 and move it to PE1, we achieve two thermal cycles of PE0 instead of three. Finally, if we vary the schedule as well and change the order of T1 and T3, the number of cycles of PE0 becomes one. Using the reliability model from \secref{sec:reliability}, we observe improvements in the MTTF of 45\% and 54\%, respectively, relative to the initial configuration.
