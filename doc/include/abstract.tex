In this paper we propose an analytical technique for the steady-state dynamic temperature analysis of multiprocessor systems with periodic applications. The approach is accurate and fast enough to be included inside an optimization loop for embedded system design. Using the proposed solution, a temperature-aware reliability optimization based on the thermal cycling failure mechanism is performed. The experimental results show that the lifetime of an embedded system can significantly be improved without sacrificing its energy efficiency by taking into consideration the steady-state dynamic temperature profile of the system during the design stage.
