An analytical technique for the steady-state dynamic temperature analysis of multiprocessor systems with periodic applications is proposed. The approach is accurate and fast enough to be included in the optimization toolbox of the embedded system design. Using the proposed solution, the temperature-aware reliability optimization based on the thermal cycling failure mechanism is performed. The experimental results show that taking into consideration the steady-state dynamic temperature fluctuations the designer of an embedded system can significatly improve its lifetime without sacrifying the energy efficiency of the system.
