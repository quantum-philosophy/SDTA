Another possible technique is iterative methods for solving systems of linear equations (e.g., Jacobi, Gauss--Seidel, Successive Overrelaxation) \cite{press2007}. These methods are designed to overcome problems of direct solvers and, consequently, they are applicable for extremely large systems. However, the most important issue with these methods is their convergence. In our experiments we did not observe any advantages of using these methods compared to the other approaches considered in this paper. Therefore, they are not further discussed.
