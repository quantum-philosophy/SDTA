Another possible technique is iterative methods for solving systems of linear equations (e.g., the Jacobi, Gaussâ€“Seidel, Successive over-relaxation methods). These methods are designed to overcome problems of direct solvers, since they do not operate on full matrices and, therefore, consume less memory. Consequently, they can be applied for extremely large systems. However, the most important issues with these methods are their convergence and accuracy. In our analysis of this particular problem we did not observe any advantages of using these methods compared to other approaches considered in this paper, since iterative methods demonstrated slow convergence and poor accuracy.
