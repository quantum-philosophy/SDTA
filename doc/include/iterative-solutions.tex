Another possible technique is iterative methods for solving systems of linear equations (e.g., the Jacobi, Gauss--Seidel, Successive over-relaxation methods \cite{press2007}). These methods are designed to overcome problems of direct solvers, since they do not operate on full matrices and, therefore, consume less memory. Consequently, they can be applied for extremely large systems. However, the most important issue with these methods is their convergence and accuracy. In our experiments we did not observe any advantages of using these methods compared to the other approaches considered in this paper, since they demonstrated slow convergence and poor accuracy. Therefore, they are not further discussed in the paper.
