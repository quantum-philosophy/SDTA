Another possible technique, that we considered but do not discuss here in details due to the shortage of space, is iterative methods for solving systems of linear systems (e.g. the Jacobi, Gaussâ€“Seidel, Successive over-relaxation methods). These methods are designed to overcome problems of direct solvers, since they do not operate on full matrices and, therefore, consume less memory. Consequently, they can be applied for extremely large systems, but the most important issues with these methods are their convergence and accuracy. In our analysis we did not observe any advantages of using this methods for this particular problem, they demonstrated slow convergence and poor accuracy.
