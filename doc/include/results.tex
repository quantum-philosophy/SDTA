\subsection{Experimental Setup}
Each processing element is described with a supply voltage in the diapason 0.6--1.0~V, a frequency in 2--4~GHz, and a number of gates in $15 \cdot 10^5$--$25 \cdot 10^5$. The application, that is being run on this multiprocessor system, consists of a number of tasks in the range 10--250. The effective switched capacitance and the number of clock cycles of each task are in the ranges $15 \cdot 10^{-9}$--$25 \cdot 10^{-9}$ and $2 \cdot 10^8$--$4 \cdot 10^8$ respectively. In \equref{eq:cycles-to-failure} the constant $b$ for brittle fracture (Si and its dielectrics) is found to be 6--9 \cite{jedec2010}, $E_{a_{TC}}$ for TC lies between 0.5--0.7~eV \cite{vigrass}.
