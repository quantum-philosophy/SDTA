The proposed solution of the steady-state dynamic temperature estimation can be used in a wide range of optimization procedures. One of them is the reliability optimization that we discuss in this section. We perform a temperature-aware task mapping and scheduling in order to address the thermal cycling aging effect while keeping the energy consumption at an appropriate level. Both mapping and scheduling are based on a genetic algorithm \cite{schmitz2004}. Let us start with the overall description of the system.

\subsection{Application Model}
The system executes a periodic application with a set of data dependent tasks. The overall structure of the application is defined by a task graph $G = (V, \: E, \: \period)$ where $V$ is a set of $N_t$ tasks (vertices of the graph), $E$ is a set of data dependencies between tasks (edges), and $\period$ is the period of the application. Each pair of a task $v_i \in V$ and processing element $\pi_j \in \Pi$ is characterized by a tuple $(NC_{ij}, C_{eff \; ij})$, where $NC_{ij}$ is the number of clock cycles and $C_{eff \; ij}$ is the effective switched capacitance. These parameters along with the architecture (\secref{sec:architecture-model}) and power (\secref{sec:power-model}) models determine the execution time of the task and processor load, respectively.

\subsection{Temperature-Aware Reliability Model} \label{sec:reliability-model}
We address temperature-driven failure mechanisms with the reliability model presented in \cite{huang2009}, \cite{xiang2010}. The model is based on the assumption that the time to failure $\mathcal{T}$ has a Weibull distribution:
\begin{align}
  & \mathcal{T} \sim Weibull(\eta, \beta) \nonumber \\
  & \expectation{\mathcal{T}} = \eta \; \Gamma(1 + \frac{1}{\beta}) \label{eq:general-mttf}
\end{align}
where $\eta$ and $\beta$ are the scaling and shape parameters of the distribution, respectively, $\Gamma$ is the gamma function. The expectation given by \equref{eq:general-mttf} is the mean time to failure (MTTF) that we denote by $\theta = \expectation{\mathcal{T}}$.

The shape parameter $\beta$ is found to be independent on the temperature variation \cite{chang2006}, which, however, is not the case with the scaling parameter $\eta$. Therefore, the distribution varies with the temperature. We can split the overall period of the application $\period$ into $N_m$ time intervals $\Delta t_i$, so that during each time interval $\Delta t_i$ the corresponding $\eta_i$ is a constant, which can be derived using \equref{eq:general-mttf}:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:eta-one}
  \eta_i = \frac{\theta_i}{\Gamma(1 + \frac{1}{\beta})}
\end{equation}
where $\theta_i$ is the MTTF in the $i$th time interval as if we had the failure distribution of this interval all the time. For now $\theta_i$ are unknown and represent a particular failure mechanism that later should be specified. As it is shown in \cite{xiang2010}, the reliability function $R(t)$, i.e., the probability of survival until an arbitrary time $t \geq 0$, can be approximated as the following:
\[
  R(t) = e^{-(\frac{t}{\period} \sum_{i=0}^{N_m - 1} \frac{\Delta t_i}{\eta_i})^\beta}
\]
The formula keeps the form of the Weibull distribution with the scaling parameter equal to:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:eta-many}
  \eta = \frac{\period}{\sum_{i=0}^{N_m - 1} \frac{\Delta t_i}{\eta_i}}
\end{equation}
Consequently, the MTTF with respect to the whole application period can be obtained by combining \equref{eq:general-mttf}, \equref{eq:eta-one}, and \equref{eq:eta-many}.

As mentioned previously, in order to compute the MTTF, we need to focus on a particular failure mechanism and determine $\theta_i$ needed by \equref{eq:eta-one}. We have chosen to focus on the thermal cycling (TC) fatigue, which is directly connected to the temperature variations. The cause of damage in this case is thermal cycles, which can be defined in a number of ways \cite{ciappa2003} and in general mean that the temperature starts from some initial value, reaches an extremum, and returns back \cite{xiang2010}. Since in really the temperature does not necessary come to the starting point and can exhibit a more complex behaviour, the cycle counting process becomes diverse. We follow the approach given in \cite{xiang2010} where the rainflow counting method is employed to distinguish between thermal cycles.

When the system is experiencing identical thermal cycles, the number of such cycles to failure can be estimated using a modified version of the well-known Coffin-Manson equation with the Arrhenius term \cite{jedec2010}, \cite{xiang2010}, \cite{ciappa2003}:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:cycles-to-failure}
  N_c = A (\Delta T - \Delta T_0)^{-b} e^{\frac{E_a}{k T_{max}}}
\end{equation}
where $A$ is an empirically determined constant, $\Delta T$ is the thermal cycle excursion, $\Delta T_0$ is the portion of the temperature range in the elastic region which does not cause damage, $b$ is the Coffin-Manson exponent which is also empirically determined, $E_{a}$ is the activation energy, $k$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T_{max}$ is the maximal temperature during the thermal cycle. Since the system can undergo a number of different cycles over the application period and each cycle causes its own damage, we let time periods $\Delta t_i$ of constant shape parameters $\eta_i$ given by \equref{eq:eta-one} be periods of thermal cycles. Therefore, having $N_m$ thermal cycles characterized by the number of cycles to failure $N_{c\:i}$ and duration $\Delta t_i$, we can compute $\theta_i$:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:mttf-cycle}
  \eta_i = N_{c \: i} \; \Delta t_i
\end{equation}
Taking equations \eqref{eq:general-mttf}, \eqref{eq:eta-one}, \eqref{eq:eta-many}, and \eqref{eq:mttf-cycle} together, we obtain the following expression to estimate the MTTF of one component in the system:
\begin{align} \label{eq:one-mttf}
  \theta = \frac{\period}{\sum_{i=0}^{N_m - 1} \frac{1}{N_{c \: i}}}
\end{align}
