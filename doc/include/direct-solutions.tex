The first straight-forward way to solve the system is to use dense solvers such as the LU decomposition \cite{press2007}. However, a more advanced approach is to employ sparse solvers since the matrix of the system given in \equref{eq:system} is a sparse matrix. Therefore, algorithms specially designed for such cases are preferable, e.g., the Unsymmetric MultiFrontal method \cite{umfpack2004}. The problem here is that the systems to solve could be extremely large, especially when a high accuracy is required. In this case, a fine-graned power profile is obtained with an increased number of steps and/or a large number of thermal nodes corresponding to a high level of details in the equivalent RC thermal circuit. Our experiments have shown that direct solvers are extremely slow and consume a large amount of memory. Therefore, we will not further consider them in the paper.
