The first straight-forward way to solve the system is to use dense solvers such as the LU decomposition \cite{press2007}. However, a more advanced approach is to employ sparse solvers since the matrix of the system given in \equref{eq:system} is a sparse matrix. Therefore, algorithms specially designed for such cases are preferable, e.g., the Unsymmetric MultiFrontal method \cite{umfpack2004}. The problem here is that the systems to solve could be extremely large, especially when a high accuracy is required. In this case, a fine-graned power profile is obtained with an increased number of steps or/and a large number of thermal nodes corresponding to a high level of details in the equivalent RC thermal circuit. Our experiments shown that direct solvers are extremely slow for such systems. Moveover, since they operate on full matrices, the amount of memory needed to perform all the computations is significantly large.
