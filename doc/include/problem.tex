Consider a multicore system that consists of $N_p$ processing elements $\Pi = \{ \pi_k: k = 0 \dots N_p - 1 \}$ and executes a periodic application with a period $\period$. We construct an equivalent RC thermal circuit of the system which contains $N_n$ thermal nodes. The dynamic power profile of the system is sampled into $N_s$ time interals of duration $\Delta t$, called sampling interval, in such a way that the dynamic power dissipation and temperature of each node are assumed to be constant within an interval. The discrete dynamic power profile is defined as $\mathbb{P}_{dyn} \eqdef \{ P_{ij}: \: i = 0 \dots N_s - 1, \: j = 0 \dots N_n - 1 \}$ where $P_{ij}$ is the dynamic power dissipation during the $i$th time interval of the $j$th thermal node. After the stabilization process is finished and the steady state is reached, the corresponding temperature profile becomes periodic and is defined as $\mathbb{T} \eqdef \{ T_{ij}: \: i = 0 \dots N_s - 1, \: j = 0 \dots N_n - 1 \}$ where $T_{ij}$ is the temperature in the $i$th time interval of the $j$th node. The profile is called the Steady-State Dynamic Temperature Profile (SSDTP).

Given:
\begin{ilist}
  \item A multicore system with a set of processing elements $\Pi$ executing a periodic application.
  \item The discrete dynamic power profile $\mathbb{P}_{\:dyn}$ of the system\footnote{The power dissipation of inactive nodes is zero.} with the sampling interval $\Delta t$.
  \item The floorplan of the chip corresponding to the level of details at which the thermal modeling is performed.
  \item The configuration of the thermal package, i.e., dimensions of the thermal interface material, heat spreader, and heat sink.
  \item The thermal parameters of the die and package, e.g., the thermal conductivity and thermal capacitance.
\end{ilist}

Find:
\begin{ilist}
  \item The corresponding periodic temperature profile $\mathbb{T}$ of the system when the steady state is reached.
\end{ilist}

Reasonable requirements for a solution are speed and accuracy, since the temperature analysis is often a part of an intensive optimization procedure where the SSDTP is to be computed thousands of times. Such a problem is described in \secref{sec:reliability}.
