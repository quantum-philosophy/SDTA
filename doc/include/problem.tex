We consider a multi-core embedded system that runs a number of periodic applications. Suppose we have a periodic power profile of the system, i.e. a profile that is composed of the same repeating chunk.

In this case, after the stabilization process, the temperature profile also becomes periodic. This temperature curve is called \ssdtc\ (SSDTC), and our goal is to find it. Furthermore, we want to calculate it quick and accurate enough to be able to use it inside some other optimization problems. In \secref{sec:experimental-results} we demonstrate a few of possible applications.
