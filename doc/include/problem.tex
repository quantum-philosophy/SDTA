Consider a multicore system that consists of $N_p$ processing elements $\Pi = \{ \pi_i: i = \range{0}{N_p - 1} \}$ and executes a periodic application with a period $\period$. We construct an equivalent RC thermal circuit of the system that contains $N_n$ thermal nodes. The dynamic power profile of the system is sampled into $N_s$ time intervals of duration $\Delta t$, called sampling interval, in such a way that the dynamic power dissipation and temperature of each node are assumed to be constant within an interval. The discrete dynamic power profile is defined as $\mathbb{P}_{dyn} \eqdef \{ P_{ij}: \: i = \range{0}{N_s - 1}; \: j = \range{0}{N_n - 1} \}$ where $P_{ij}$ is the dynamic power dissipation during the $i$th time interval of the $j$th thermal node. After the steady state is reached, the corresponding temperature profile becomes periodic and is defined as $\mathbb{T} \eqdef \{ T_{ij}: \: i = \range{0 }{N_s - 1}; \: j = \range{0}{N_n - 1} \}$ where $T_{ij}$ is the temperature of the $j$th node in the $i$th time interval. The profile is called the steady-state dynamic temperature profile (SSDTP).

\statement{Given}:
\begin{ilist}
  \item A multicore system with a set of processing elements $\Pi$ executing a periodic application.
  \item The discrete dynamic power profile $\mathbb{P}_{\:dyn}$ of the system\footnote{Power dissipation of inactive nodes, i.e., the nodes that belong to the thermal package, is zero.} with the sampling interval $\Delta t$.
  \item The floorplan of the chip corresponding to the level of details at which the thermal modeling is performed.
  \item The configuration of the thermal package, i.e., dimensions of the thermal interface material, heat spreader, and heat sink.
  \item The thermal parameters of the die and package, e.g., the thermal conductivity and thermal capacitance.
\end{ilist}

\statement{Find}:
\begin{ilist}
  \item The corresponding periodic temperature profile $\mathbb{T}$ of the system when the steady state is reached.
\end{ilist}
% Reasonable requirements for a solution are speed and accuracy, since the temperature analysis is often a part of an intensive optimization procedure where the SSDTP is to be computed thousands of times. Such a problem is described in \secref{sec:reliability}.
