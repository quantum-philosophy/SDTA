We consider a multiprocessor embedded system that runs a number of periodic tasks. We assume that the power profile of the system is given, and it has periodic nature. Therefore, the overall profile is described with one repeating chunk.

In this case, after the stabilization process, the temperature profile also becomes periodic. This temperature curve is called \ssdtc\ (SSDTC), and our goal is to find it. Furthermore, we want to calculate it quick and accurate enough to be able to use it inside other optimization problems. An example of such problem is given in \secref{sec:experimental-results}.
