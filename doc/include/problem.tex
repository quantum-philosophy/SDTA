Consider a multicore system that consists of $N_p$ processing elements $\Pi = \{ \pi_k: k = 0 \dots N_p - 1 \}$ and executes a periodic application with an overall period $\mathcal{T}$. The application period is discretized into $N_s$ intervals $\triangle t_i$ for $i = 0 \dots N_s - 1$ in such a way that the power dissipation and temperature of each core are assumed to be constant within them. The discrete power profile is defined as a matrix:
\begin{equation*}
  \mathbb{P} = \left[
    \begin{array}{c}
      P_0^T \\
      \vdots \\
      P_{N_s - 1}^T
    \end{array}
  \right] = \left[
    \begin{array}{ccc}
      P_{0, \: 0} & \cdots & P_{0, \: N_p - 1} \\
      \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
      P_{N_s - 1, \: 0} & \cdots & P_{N_s - 1, \: N_p - 1}
    \end{array}
  \right]
\end{equation*}
where $P_{ij}$ is the power dissipation during the $i$th time interval of the $j$th processing element\footnote{For instance, system profiling techniques with cycle-accurate simulators, e.g., MPARM \cite{benini2005} and Wattch \cite{brooks2000}, can be employed to obtain such a power profile.}. After the stabilization process is finished, the corresponding temperature profile becomes periodic and is defined as the following:
\begin{equation*}
  \mathbb{T} = \left[
    \begin{array}{c}
      T_0^T \\
      \vdots \\
      T_{N_s - 1}^T
    \end{array}
  \right] = \left[
    \begin{array}{ccc}
      T_{0, \: 0} & \cdots & T_{0, \: N_p - 1} \\
      \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
      T_{N_s - 1, \: 0} & \cdots & T_{N_s - 1, \: N_p - 1}
    \end{array}
  \right]
\end{equation*}
where $T_{ij}$ is the temperature of the $j$th core on the $i$th time interval. We refer to this profile as the \emph{Steady-State Dynamic Temperature Profile} (SSDTP).

Given:
\begin{itemize}
  \item A periodic power profile $\mathbb{P}$ of a multicore system with a set of processing elements $\Pi$.
  \item The floorplan of the chip, i.e., the location and size of each processing element $\pi_k \in \Pi$.
  \item The configuration of the package including the thermal interface material, heat spreader, and heat sink.
  \item The thermal parameters of the die and package (the thermal conductivity, thermal capacitance, etc.).
\end{itemize}

Find:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The corresponding periodic temperature profile $\mathbb{T}$ of the system when the steady state is reached.
\end{itemize}

Reasonable requirements for a solution are speed and accuracy, since the temperature analysis is often a part of an intensive optimization procedure where the SSDTC is to be computed thousands of times. Such an intensive problem is described in \secref{sec:reliability}.

Since thermal nodes in an equivalent RC thermal circuit do not necessary directly reflect the processing elements of the system, let profiles $\mathbb{P}$ and $\mathbb{T}$ be $N_s \times N_n$ matrices instead of $N_s \times N_p$.
