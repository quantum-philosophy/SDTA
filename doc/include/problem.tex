Suppose we have a periodic power profile with the following repeating chunk:
\[
  B = \left[
    \begin{array}{ccc}
      \dindex{b}{0}{0} & \cdots & \dindex{b}{0}{cores-1} \\
      \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
      \dindex{b}{m-1}{0} & \cdots & \dindex{b}{m-1}{cores-1}
    \end{array}
  \right]
\]
where:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $m$ --- the number of steps in a chunk,
  \item $b_{ij}$ --- the power supplied to the $i$-th core on the $j$-th step.
\end{itemize}

In this case, after the stabilization process, the temperature profile also becomes periodic. This temperature curve is called \ssdtc\ (SSDTC), and our goal is to find it. One approach could be to run HotSpot (the tool) with a very long power profile composed of small repeating chunks. But it would take much time to compute.
