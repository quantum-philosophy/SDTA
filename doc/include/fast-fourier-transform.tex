The overall matrix of the system under the assumption of the equal time intervals becomes a block Toeplitz matrix. To be more specific, the matrix is a block-circulant matrix where each block row vector is rotated one block element to the right relative to the preceding block row vector. This leads us to a wide range of possible techniques to solve the system, e.g., the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) \cite{mazancourt1983, vescovo1997} that we include in our experiments in \secref{sec:results-ssdtp}.
