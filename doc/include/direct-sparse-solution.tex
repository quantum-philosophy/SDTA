One may notice that the matrix $\mathbb{A}$ is an extremely sparse matrix with a very specific structure that can be observed in \figref{fig:sparseness-of-system}. The matrix has non-zero elements only on its block diagonal (composed of $N_n \times N_n$ matrices), one subdiagonal just above the block diagonal, and one subdiagonal in the left bottom corner. Therefore, instead of the dense LU decomposition we can apply algorithms that are specially designed for such cases.
In our experiments we use the UMFPACK library, a set of routines for solving unsymmetric sparse linear systems based on the Unsymmetric MultiFrontal method (UMF) \cite{umfpack2004}.
