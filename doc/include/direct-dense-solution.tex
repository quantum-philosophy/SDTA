The first straight-forward way to solve the system is to use dense solvers such as the LU decomposition \cite{press2007}. The problem here is that the systems to solve could be extremely large, especially when we want to achieve a higher accuracy and, therefore, the power profile contains a lot of steps $N_s$. Each new step produces $N_n$ new equations in the system given by \equref{eq:system}. The complexity grows very rapidly with the number of processing elements $N_p$. For instanse, one of the models implemented in HotSpot is based on the relation $N_n = 4 \times N_p + 12$ where each new core increases the system by $4 \times N_s$ equations and $4 \times N_s$ unknowns. All in all, a fast and accurate approach to solve \equref{eq:system} is required.
