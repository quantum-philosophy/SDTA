As it was shown in \secref{sec:hotspot-solution}, the state of the art solutions either produce inaccurate and, in extreme cases, completely useless results, or they are unacceplably slow. In this section we eliminate the first problem by obtaining an analytical expression of the SSDTP and tackle the second one in \secref{sec:condensed-equation} where a fast technique to perform the computations is proposed.

In the onwards explanation, without loss of generality, we assume $\v{T}(t) \equiv \v{T}(t) - \v{T}_{amb}$. Let the power consumption vector $\v{P}(t)$ be constant and equal to $\v{P}$, then the system given by \equref{eq:fourier-model} is a system of ordinary differential equations (ODE) with the following solution:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:solution}
  \v{T}(t) = e^{\m{A} t} \; \v{T}_0 + \m{A}^{-1}(e^{\m{A} t} - \m{I})\m{C}^{-1} \v{P}
\end{equation}
where $\m{A} = -\m{C}^{-1} \: \m{G}$ and $\v{T}_0$ is the initial temperature. Therefore, given a discrete power profile, the corresponding temperature profile can be found using the following recurrence:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:recurrent-system}
  \v{T}_{i+1} = \m{K}_i \: \v{T}_i + \m{B}_i \: \v{P}_i
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{align*}
  & \m{K}_i = e^{\m{A} \Delta t_i} \\
  & \m{B}_i = \m{A}^{-1}(e^{\m{A} \Delta t_i} - \m{I})\m{C}^{-1}
\end{align*}

\subsection{Transient Temperature Analysis}
Given the initial temperature $\v{T}_0$, the recurrence in \equref{eq:recurrent-system} can be applied to perform the TTA. Our experiments show that in the case of equal time intervals, where $\m{K}_i$ and $\m{B}_i$ are constants, this approach demonstrates a significant performance improvement relative to iterative solutions of ODEs, e.g., the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method implemented in HotSpot. The same observation is made in \cite{thiele2011}.

The TTA using the analytical technique given in \equref{eq:recurrent-system} can be employed to approximate the SSDTP as it is described in \secref{sec:hotspot-iterative-solution} dramatically speeding up the computational process. However, the number of required simulations is unchanged since it is basically an alternative way to perform the same type of analysis. The technique that we shall propose later on equals to only two simulations using the above-mentioned analytical approach while the produced solutions are exact.

\subsection{Steady-State Dynamic Temperature Analysis}
For the steady-state case the following system of linear equations can be derived from \equref{eq:recurrent-system}:
\[
  \begin{cases}
    \m{K}_0 \: \v{T}_0 - \v{T}_1 & = -\m{B}_0 \: \v{P}_0 \\
    ... \\
    -\v{T}_0 + \m{K}_{N_s - 1} \: \v{T}_{N_s - 1} & = -\m{B}_{N_s - 1} \: \v{P}_{N_s - 1}
  \end{cases}
\]
where the last equation respects the boundary condition and ensures the equality of temperature values on both ends of the overall period:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:boundary-condition}
  \v{T}_0 = \v{T}_{N_s}
\end{equation}
To get the whole picture, the system can be written as:
\begin{align}
  & \mathbb{K} \: \mathbb{X} = \mathbb{B} \label{eq:system} \\
  & \mathbb{K} = \left[
    \begin{array}{ccccc}
      \m{K}_0 & -\m{I} & 0 & \cdots & 0 \\
      0 & \m{K}_1 & -\m{I} &  & \vdots \\
      \vdots &  & \ddots & -\m{I} & 0 \\
      0 &  &  & \m{K}_{N_s - 2} & -\m{I} \\
      -\m{I} & 0 & \cdots & 0 & \m{K}_{N_s - 1}
    \end{array}
  \right] \nonumber \\
  & \mathbb{X} = \left[
    \begin{array}{c}
      \v{T}_0 \\
      \vdots \\
      \v{T}_{N_s - 1}
    \end{array}
  \right] \nonumber \\
  & \mathbb{B} = \left[
    \begin{array}{c}
      -\m{B}_0 \: \v{P}_0 \\
      \vdots \\
      -\m{B}_{N_s - 1} \: \v{P}_{N_s - 1}
    \end{array}
  \right] \nonumber
\end{align}
where $\mathbb{K}$ is a $N_n N_s \times N_n N_s$ matrix, $\mathbb{X}$ and $\mathbb{B}$ are vectors with $N_n N_s$ elements.

It can be seen that we have obtained a regular system of liner equations with a specific structure. Now we shall briefly discuss possible alternatives to solve it.
