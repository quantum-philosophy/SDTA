In the paper we demonstrated the importance of the steady-state dynamic temperature analysis for the multiprocessor system design. We formutated the problem and proposed a fast technique to solve it. The solution is analytical, therefore, it is precise in terms of the underlying RC thermal model. Using the proposed approach, we conducted a temperature-aware reliability optimization based on the thermal cycling failure mechanism and shown that taking into consideration the steady-state dynamic temperature profile of the system can significantly prolong its lifetime.
