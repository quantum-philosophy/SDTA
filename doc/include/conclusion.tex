The SSDTA is an essential part of the embedded system design. In this paper we formutated the problem and proposed an elegant anlytical technique to solve it. The solution is both accurate and fast enough to be a decent tool of the designer. Using the proposed approach, we conducted a temperature-aware reliability optimization based on the thermal cycling failure mechanism and shown that taking into consideration the temperature variations within a multicore platform can significantly prolong its lifetime without affecting its energy efficiency.
