In this paper we have proposed an efficient and accurate technique to calculate the SSDTP of an embedded multiprocessor system. Using the proposed approach, we conducted a temperature-aware reliability optimization based on the thermal cycling failure mechanism and have shown that taking into consideration the temperature variations within a multicore platform can significantly prolong its lifetime without affecting its energy efficiency. The improvement, compared using the state of the art, is significant.
