In this paper we shown the importance of the steady-state dynamic temperature analysis for different aspects of the multiprocessor system design. We formutated the problem and presented possible solutions. First, we discussed what can be achieved with the existing HotSpot simulator, and then we proposed an analytical solution to the problem. The solution is precise from the perspective of the underlying model and by far faster than possible alternatives with the same accuracy (to the best knowledge of the authors). We also considered the thermal cycling failure mechanism and conducted the reliability optimization based on it.
