\subsection{Temperature Variation}
Morden policies for prevening temperature runaways and decreasing energy consumption, within such tecniques as dynamic power management (DPM) and dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS), keep puzzling embedded system architects with a constantly increasing strength. These and similar approaches may cause considerable temperature fluctuations within a multiprocessor system-on-chip (MPSoC), therefore, dramatically decreasing its reliability \cite{mihic2004}, \cite{simunic2005}.

The importance of the temperature distribution over ICs has been widely studied in the literature \cite{lu2004}. Hence, a large number of different methods for performance and energy optimization imposes the maximal temperature constrain. In this essence, the need of fast and accurate methods for obtaining temperature profiles becomes urgent.

In this paper we consider the HotSpot thermal model \cite{huang2006} and propose an extremely fast way to calculate the steady-state dynamic temperature curve (SSDTC) of an embedded system that executes a set of periodic tasks.

In order to demonstrate our approach, we perform the energy optimization with a constrain on the spatial temperature gradient within a die. The constrain is satisfied with the help of SSDTC that delivers the diapason of the temperature fluctuation. The optimization problem is solved through the mapping and scheduling based on genetic algorithms and the list scheduler described in \cite{schmitz2004}.
